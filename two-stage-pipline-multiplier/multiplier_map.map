      Number using O6 output only:              31
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                   38
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     10
      Number with same-slice register load:      5
      Number with same-slice carry load:         5
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    24 out of     600    4%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        88 out of   1,200    7%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           87
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            31 out of      87   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of      87    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          50 out of      87   57%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               4 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
